<h1>MeteorEatyor's Response to "We Need To Fix Black Hair in Video Games"</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Loose Thesis Collection</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Diversity in staff is necessary to present diversity in project outcome.</li>
    <li>Character customization should allow diverse audiences to feel seen ingame.</li>
    <li>Fan works are able to fill in some gaps, and developers should remain friendly to customization from fans.</li>
    <li>The industry should invest in diverse voices.</li>
    <li>Black hair faces stigmatization in most of the world, so representing it can make a person with black hair feel comforted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Elaborated Thoughts</h2>
<p> Diversity of perspective in the industry is something that has been lacking for decades. Hairstyles are just one of the very visible ways that it can manifest. Once games scale up to larger than an indipendent studio, a lot of corporate trappings quickly worm their way into the production process. I really wish I could see the same amount of diverse perspectives that I see when finely browsing itch.io in the triple A industry. Hair matters to people, culture, art in general. It's a cultural expression, like almost all parts of appearance and tailoring. Especially black culture, which has a storied history of barbers expanding upon cultural expression with hairstyling. It therefore goes that it requires perspective to fully manifest beyond something that feels half-baked. If your game is going to advertise a diverse array of avatars, then there's really no excuse a modern multi-billion dollar triple A studio has to not hire as diverse.

<h3>Personal Note</h3>
<p> Hair's a very emotionally loaded subject for me. Being frank, I'm a white girl from a white background with hair that registered as just too curly and unusual enough to get some real harassment from my hardened conservative home enviroment. I have an emotional investment in this sort of thing. 
</p>

<p> It's obviously not the same experience as having black hair, my hair hasn't been explicitly banned in any books for example. But my formative years were spent where the only characters not being furiously harassed for having hair like mine were in cartoons, comics, and games. This thing matters, I know it does first hand.
