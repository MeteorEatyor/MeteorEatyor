<h1>MeteorEatyor's Response to "How Unserious (and Problematic) SIGCSE Is."</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Loose Thesis Collection</h2>
<ul>
    <li>How do we define elitism?</li>
    <li>What might need to change in the peer review process?</li>
    <li>What are the merrits to catergorizing papers by review?</li>
    <li>Should we publicize who is in charge of reviewing papers?</li>
    <li>What power might publicizing peer review notes give to disadvantaged authors?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Elaborated Thoughts</h2>
<p>We currently only really know how to structure academic circles around hierarchies. Often senior professionals work their way up the chain, with the exceptionally well performing ascending at a rapid rate. This has its inherent disadvantages, young voices are rarely heard over their awarded seniors. The young voices that are amplified in these circles are often the ones that senior members choose to amplify. Therefore, literally old-fashioned thinking ends up determining a large part of the output of these spaces. Bigotry is not generally challenged because of the career incentives given to majority groups to comply. However, for the people who just want to be heard and have their work published, they often do bravely expose the outdated practices inside these spaces. 
</p>

<p>A lot of the discrimination in these circles is quiet, often evasive. You’re not going to see direct offensive, but rather a looming unwillingness to converse with diverse voices. More specifically, when there is research that offends the status quo, we see examples of peer review groups to undermine these papers. The bar is suddenly much higher, people who are already disadvantaged are required to turn in perfect quality papers less their work be dismissed completely. Even when it is perfect, there is absolutely no guarantee that paper will be offered the same decency as others. </p>
