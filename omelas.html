    <br>
    <h2>My Thesises</h2>
    <br>
    <div>What does Omelas mean to say about human suffering? Is the presumption that pleasure and suffering are intertwined? Is the point of making the basement child so pitiful and Omelas so perfect to validate those who walk? Is the act of walking ideological? A metaphor for those who refuse to participate in a precieved Omelas? Whom is the child of Omelas? If the ignorant people of Omelas are the opposing force, who is the protagoist?</div>
    <br>
    <h2>my Expanded Thoughts: a Smarter Person Once Told me that Guilt was Invented.</h2>
    <br>
    <div id="textbox"><p>Good things need bad things to happen. It is known that this belief drives many philosophies. The natural extreme of this philosophy is the story of Omelas. Omelas does not posit much new in the realm of philosophy, merely expanding on a pre-existing understanding of mortality as causal. The more good, the more bad must happen. Therefore, there is nobody that is more punished than the child of Omelas, for their burden is of the entire city of Omelas. This relationship is confounding. <strong>The child of Omelas is banished to an eternity in hell for crimes of neither himself nor his people, only that there is other pleasures in the world.</strong></p></div>

    <p>It is very cute that Omelas is Salem-O backwards. My sites are coded in dark-mode to protect my eyes.</p>
