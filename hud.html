<h1>MeteorEatyor's Response to "Facebook/Meta Discrimination Cases"</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Loose Thesis Collection</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Advertising tools are a great concern of digital rights.</li>
    <li>Online platforms such as Facebook/Meta are recklessly optimizing for monetization.</li>
    <li>Online advertisers are attempting to build racial, class, and national profiles out of ad data.</li>
    <li>How can we meaningfully intervene in the online advertising process?</li>
    <li>How can we guarantee an financially sustainable interet without advertising?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Elaborated Thoughts</h2>
<p>Facebook and the larger Meta umbrella conglomerate have been the subject of scrutiny for a long time. Facebook's mediocre rise was marked with a lot of decisions that were thought of as potentially inasive at the time, and have spiraled into incidents such as racially discriminating housing ads. A lot of this information is retrospective reading because I am 20. By the time that I was an adolescent facebook had already become the default social media platform, besides only twitter. A lot of my early teenage connections were fostered and made possible by Facebook. This is where I'm coming from. I see Facebook as this culmination of many big marketing decisions throughout the 00s and 10s that resulted in a massive, useful, and extremely predatory online platform that has influenced my life personally. </p>
<br>

<p>The ruthless advertising on the platform was a subject of criticism, if not the most popular one for a lot of Facebook's lifespan. Facebook was a platform based on personal presentation moreso than a lot of its contemporaries before and since. As Meta continued to lean into increasingly more predatory monetization schemes, and as collecting and selling ad data became the default mode of web monetization. This was not an unexpected conclusion. But the repair work has to come. I'm not sure if it's tighter government regulation of these large social media companies, or just web advertising in general. It may mean soon that we need to move away from collecting and selling as much personal information as we can to keep the internet afloat. Our current monetization system is so fiercly predatory that even nightmare cases like this are just the ones we know of. </p>
