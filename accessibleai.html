<h1>MeteorEatyor's Response to "How AI is Improving Accessability."</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Loose Thesis Collection</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Generative language models have the potential to enhance captioning</li>
    <li>The pattern recognitiion of larger AI models can help neurodivergent youths make fundamental connections.</li>
    <li>Predictive models can help summarize text in a way that is convenient for everyone.</li>
    <li>There are some potential dangers inherent to letting famously biased AI form our children's worldview.</li>
    <li>Accessability should not be a profit-driven pursuit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Elaborated Thoughts</h2>
<p> I think that there are a lot of potential applications for offering better accessability options to neurodivergent and disabled people, especially youths with the models that are currently being invented. Tools like auto-caption are already great, and these technologies only stand to potentially make them much better. I however am deeply concerned about the latter half of this article, because it preturbed me greatly to see the ways in which neurodivergent development was described as a potential boon for business owners developing these technologies. While it is true that neurodivergent development may make some people inclined to certain mental behaviors that are beneficial for niche cases, I believe this article discusses this topic in the most slimey profit-centered way I can imagine. I believe that the line "Companies also appreciate neurodivergent employees’ affinity for repetitive tasks, which can cause burnout in many neurotypical workers, and their loyalty to the company as they are less likely to leave for other opportunities" should be valid cause of an ethics investigation of this website.  </p>
